              <p class="paragraph">
                This project started as a personal side project. I got the idea
                from the Saved Messages telegram feature, whose interface is
                technically a chat. I used to use that chat to save some of my
                links, but I wanted a way to group them by category. That's why
                I decided to build my own bookmark keeper app (For the record,
                It was after I finished the app that I found out about Pocket).
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                I used the MERN stack dividing the project into API and client.
                For the backend, I used the
                <a
                  class="inline-link"
                  href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/link-preview-js"
                >
                  link-preview-js npm library
                </a>
                by Oscar Franco to present the site information and Passport JS
                with JWT for authentication and authorization. As for the client
                UI design, it uses Material UI and its card component to make
                the bookmarks similar to the link previews you can find on chat
                apps. Recently I migrated these projects, and now Typescript is
                utilized on both.

                WPF Invoice System Windows App
              </h3>
              <p class="paragraph">
                I came up with this idea while working in my family business.
                They had stopped using the previous invoice system of the
                company because it had many bugs and the license was expensive.
                In addition, I have always been interested in building a Windows
                desktop application, and I knew C#, so I decided to make a new
                invoice system for the company. The project was a challenge for
                my Object Oriented Programming skills, and I even had the
                opportunity to put into practice some design patterns. The
                project in this portfolio is a lightweight version of that
                project because the original project has more company-related
                features that I decided not to include here.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                I choose WPF instead of newer frameworks (MAUI, for instance)
                primarily because of the old hardware that we have in the
                company. I also used the Prism library for an easier way of
                handling navigation.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Now about persistence: I went with SQL Server in the original
                project, but I used SQLite for this project so that the people
                who want to try this project can have their data in the desktop
                directory of their computers. In both cases, I managed the DB
                through Entity Framework code-first approach.

                Countries info app (Frontend mentor challenge)
              </h3>
              <p class="paragraph">
                This project is my solution for the Frontend Mentor REST
                Countries API challenge. A priori, it seemed to be a project
                with a straightforward development process, but it started to
                get more complex as I built it. Creating the dropdown filter
                from scratch was indeed challenging, not only because of the
                design but also because of the accessibility aspects you have to
                cover. You learn a lot while building this project; I recommend
                it if you want to exercise your frontend developer skills. I
                created it using the Next.js static generation feature,
                Typescript, and modern React tools such as Hooks and functional
                components. Thanks to Github Actions, the site is automatically
                rebuilt monthly to keep countries' data up to date. Finally, for
                styling, I used CSS with SASS as a preprocessor. A previous
                version of this application that a built using only React can be
                found

                I am a JavaScript and .Net software developer interested in
                expanding my abilities with professional experience. I started
                learning software development four years ago, and the more I
                learned about coding, the more I fell in love whit it. I learned
                most of my developer skills from Mosh Hamedani's courses, which
                I find very comprehensive with attention to good practices. I
                also acquired a Platzi subscription, a platform of online
                courses, where I've been working on my developer skills for the
                past years.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                For the first part of my journey, I focused on the "MERN"
                JavaScript stack learning C# syntax along the way. Still,
                recently I started working with .Net technologies, and I'm
                currently working on a couple of .Net projects to showcase on
                this portfolio.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                I'm based in Venezuela, and when I'm not coding, I like to play
                guitar and watch a lot of films.
