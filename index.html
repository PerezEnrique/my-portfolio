								Countries info app (Frontend mentor challenge)
							</h3>
							<p class="paragraph">
								This is my solution for the Frontend Mentor REST Countries API
								challenge. A priori it seemed to be a project with a straightforward 
								development process, but it started to get more complex as I built it. The
								creation of the dropdown filter from scratch was indeed challenging, not
								only because of the design but also because of the accessibility aspects
								you have to cover. You learn a lot while building this project, I for sure
								recommend it if you want to exercise your frontend developer skills. It
								was built using the Next.js static generation feature along with Typescript 
								and modern React tools such as Hooks and functional components. Thanks to 
								Github Actions the site is automatically rebuilt monthly to keep countries'
								data up to date. Finally, for styling, I used CSS with SASS as a preprocessor.
								A previous version of this application that a built using only React can be
								found <a class="inline-link" href="https://github.com/PerezEnrique/countries-info-app">here</a>.

							<h3 class="title title--project">Bookmarks keeper</h3>
							<p class="paragraph">
								This project started as a personal side project, I get the idea from the
								Saved Messages telegram feature, whose interface is technically a chat. I
								used to use that chat to save some of my links but I wanted a way to group
								them by category. That's why I decided to build my own bookmark keeper
								app. For that, I used the MERN stack but divided the project into API and
								client. In the backend I used the
								<a class="inline-link" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/link-preview-js"
									>link-preview-js npm library
								</a>
								by Oscar Franco, to present the site information and Passport JS with JWT
								for authentication and authorization. Regarding the client UI design, it
								uses Material UI and I use the card component to try to make the bookmarks
								similar to the link previews you can see on chat apps.

							<p class="paragraph">
								I am a JavaScript software developer, who is very interested in expanding
								my abilities with professional experience. I started learning software
								development three years ago, and the more I learned about coding, the more
								I fell in love whit it. That's why after two years of self-learning I
								decided to acquire a Platzi subscription, this is a platform of on-line
								courses, where I've been working on my developer skills for the past
								years.
							</p>
							<p class="paragraph">
								On this journey, I've been focused on the "MERN" stack and now Next.js, 
								but I've as well worked with other technologies such as Redux, GraphQL, 
								and SQL. Currently, I'm learning React Native and I'm looking forward to 
								learning dotNet in the future.
							</p>
							<p class="paragraph">
								I’m based in Venezuela and when I’m not coding, I like to play guitar and
								watch a lot of films.
