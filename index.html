                WPF Invoice System Windows App
              </h3>
              <p class="paragraph">
                I came up with this idea while working in my family business.
                They had stopped using the previous invoice system of the
                company because it had many bugs and the license was expensive.
                In addition, I had always been interested in building a Windows
                desktop application, and I knew C#, so I decided to make a new
                invoice system for the company. The development was a challenge
                for my Object Oriented Programming skills, and I even had the
                opportunity to put into practice some design patterns. The
                project in this portfolio is a lightweight version of that
                project because the latter has more company-related features
                that I decided not to include here.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                I choose WPF for the windows client app development instead of
                newer frameworks such as MAUI, primarily because of the old
                hardware that we have in the company. I also used the Prism
                library for an easier way of handling navigation.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Now about persistence: I went with SQL Server in the original
                project, but for this one I used SQLite so that it is easier to
                offer to the users testing this porfolio app, an option to clear
                the date they inserted. It's also important to note that, in
                both cases, I managed the DB through Entity Framework code-first
                approach.

              </h3>
              <p class="paragraph">
                I participated in a 5-week work simulation as a Backend
                Developer within a diverse team of talented developers and UI/UX
                designers. There, we built a MVP called AcompaÃ±ar+ with React
                and Express.js. The project aims to create a bridge between the
                elderly and the new generations through community activities.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                This was such a rewarding experience because I had the
                opportunity to improve several of my soft skills such as
                teamwork, problem-solving and also my ability to communicate
                complex technical concepts across different disciplines. Also,
                since we had a compressed timeframe, I gained valuable
                experience in prioritizing tasks and adapting to changing
                project requirements.

                This was a personal side project. I got the idea
                from the Saved Messages telegram feature, whose interface is
                technically a chat. I used to use that chat to save some of my
                links, but I wanted a way to group them by category. That's why
                I decided to build my own bookmark keeper app (For the record,
                It was after I finished the app that I found out about Pocket).
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                I used the MERN stack dividing the project into API and client.
                For the backend, I used the

                </a>
                by Oscar Franco to present the site information and Passport JS
                with JWT for authentication and authorization. As for the client
                UI design, it uses Material UI and its card component to make
                the bookmarks similar to the link previews you can find on chat
                apps. Recently I migrated these projects, and now Typescript is
                utilized on both.
