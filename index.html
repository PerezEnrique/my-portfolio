								Countries info app (Frontend mentor challenge)
							</h3>
							<p class="paragraph">
								This is my personal solution for the Frontend Mentor REST Countries API
								challenge. A priori it seemed to be a project with an straighforwad
								development process, but it started to get more complex as I builded it.
								The creation of the dropdown filter from scratch is really challenging,
								not only because of the design but also because of the accessibility
								aspects you have to cover. You learn a lot building this project, I for
								sure recommend it if you want to exercise your frontend developer skills.

							<h3 class="title title--project">Bookmarks keeper</h3>
							<p class="paragraph">
								This project started as a personal side project, I get the idea from the
								Saved Messages telegram feature, which interface is actually a chat. I
								used to use that chat to save some of my links but I wanted a way to group
								them by category. That's why I decided to build my own bookmark keeper
								app. For that, I used the MERN stack, but divided the project in API and
								client. In the backend I used the
								<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/link-preview-js"
									>link-preview-js npm library
								</a>
								by Oscar Franco, to present the site information, and Passport JS with JWT
								for authentication and authorization. Regarding the client UI design, it
								uses Material UI and I use the card component to try to make the bookmarks
								similar to the link previews you can see on chat apps.

							<h2 class="title title--sub">About Me</h2>
							<p class="paragraph">
								I’m a junior developer looking for a new role in an exciting company. I've
								been teaching myself software development for three years now, and the
								more I learned about coding, the more I fell in love whit it, to the
								extent that I ended learning technologies such as React, Express and even
								Redux. As you can probably tell, in my journey, I've been focused in the
								"MERN" stack, but I've as well worked with MySQL, and I'm looking forward
								to learn cloud soon. I’m based in Venezuela and when I’m not coding, I
								like to play guitar, and watching a lot of films. I’d love you to check
								out some of my work.
