							<p class="paragraph">
								I’m a junior developer looking for a new role in an exciting company. I've
								been teaching myself web development for two years, in what initialy was
								meant to be a short term process to become a freelance who would use HTML,
								CSS and JS to build static sites. But the more I learned about coding, the
								more I fell in love whit it and I ended learning technologies such as
								React, Express and Redux. As you can probably tell, in my journey, I've
								been focused in the "MERN" stack, but I'm currently learning MySQL and I
								plan to learn Python as well. I’m based in Venezuela and when I’m not
								coding, I like to play guitar, and watching a lot of films. I’d love you
								to check out some of my work.

							<p class="paragraph">
								This project was challenging because the external API that it consumes is
								not that flexible as I expected to be, but was really cool coming up with
								interesting solutions for the diferents obstacles I found on the way. Also
								I wanted to use a custom design that allowed me to put in practice my CSS
								skills and, even when I'm liking the result so far, I'd probably be adding
								some features in the future in order to polish it.

								I took me some time to finish this project but I wanted to build an
								e-commerce site. With this project, as it grew up in size, I learned a lot
								about the importance of keeping the order in your code. I used Bootstrap
								for the design and Redux for the state management.
