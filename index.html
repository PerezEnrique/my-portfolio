                WPF Invoice System Windows App
              </h3>
              <p class="paragraph">
                I came up with this idea while working in my family business.
                They had stopped using the previous invoice system of the
                company because it had many bugs and the license was expensive.
                In addition, I had always been interested in building a Windows
                desktop application, and I knew C#, so I decided to make a new
                invoice system for the company. The development was a challenge
                for my Object Oriented Programming skills, and I even had the
                opportunity to put into practice some design patterns. The
                project in this portfolio is a lightweight version of that
                project because the latter has more company-related features
                that I decided not to include here.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                I choose WPF for the windows client app development instead of
                newer frameworks such as MAUI, primarily because of the old
                hardware that we have in the company. I also used the Prism
                library for an easier way of handling navigation.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Now about persistence: I went with SQL Server in the original
                project, but for this one I used SQLite so that it is easier to
                offer to the users testing this porfolio app, an option to clear
                the date they inserted. It's also important to note that, in
                both cases, I managed the DB through Entity Framework code-first
                approach.

                Acompañar+ (No Country Simulation MVP)
              </h3>
              <p class="paragraph">
                I participated in a 5-week work simulation as a Backend
                Developer within a diverse team of talented developers and UI/UX
                designers. There, we built a MVP called Acompañar+ with React
                and Express.js. The project aims to create a bridge between the
                elderly and the new generations through community activities.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                This was such a rewarding experience because I had the
                opportunity to improve several of my soft skills such as
                teamwork, problem-solving and also my ability to communicate
                complex technical concepts across different disciplines. Also,
                since we had a compressed timeframe, I gained valuable
                experience in prioritizing tasks and adapting to changing
                project requirements.

                I am a .Net and JavaScript backend developer who also has
                Windows applications development knowledge. I started learning
                software development five years ago, and I discovered I really
                like using tech to solve problems. I decided to make a career
                out of it and prepare myself more earnestly for it, so I signed
                up on some e-learning platforms.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                I focused on the "MERN" JavaScript stack for the first part of
                my journey. Later, I learned C# and I realized I enjoyed more to
                program on the backend. From here, I worked with .Net
                technologies, building Windows desktop applications with WPF and
                APIs with ASP.Net Core. I have used much of that knowledge while
                working in my family's business. I never stop learning; that's
                why, at the moment, I'm studying AWS and Azure.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                I'm based in Venezuela, and when I'm not coding, I like to watch
                a lot of films and play guitar.
